### Hi there 👋
My name is Cirano, I'm 22 years old and I'm changing my carrer 😁 I recently graduated in Civil Engineering, but during my graduation, I noticed that I really liked the disciplines and jobs that used programming, so I realized that now was the time to focus on what really is my passion: software development.
A few days ago I finished the Generation's Bootcamp where I learned JAVA, Spring Boot, React and improved my communication, adaptability and future orientation through teamwork.
